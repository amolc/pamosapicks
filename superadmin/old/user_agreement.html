                <p class="user-text mt-2">In addition to the Limitations of Liabilities described in Section 4, User understands that the Iamstockbot Automated Algo System, (referred to as "The TD System") and results shown herein are for informational purposes only. All the information included herein should not be considered as a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security or use any trading system.</p>
                <p class="user-text mt-2">User understands that TD is not responsible for any losses that may result from whatever action you elect to take based on your use of TD Services including The TD System. The TD System may highlight different types of systems or algorithms from which User may choose to execute trades. Any type of system or algorithm User elects bears certain risks, along with the inherent financial risks related to investing in the stock market.</p>
                <p class="user-text mt-2">When trades are executed in real market conditions using market orders, User may suffer financial losses due to market instability and/or volatility which may cause the market to move against User's position. Therefore, a decision to trade in the stock market is made at User's own risk and responsibility. It is strongly recommended that User does their own research prior to commencing trading.</p>
                <p class="user-text mt-2">The TD System assumes trades occur with at least one share with no consideration for partial fills, nor increased market order slippage. Therefore, User's actual trading results may not match the results displayed in The TD System panel.</p>
                <p class="user-text mt-2">Hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.</p>

                <p class="user-text mt-2">Any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, shall be settled solely and exclusively by binding arbitration in San Jose, California. Such arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the then prevailing commercial arbitration rules of JAMS/Endispute ("JAMS"), with the following exceptions if in conflict: (a) one arbitrator shall be chosen by JAMS; (b) each party to the arbitration will pay its pro rata share of the expenses and fees of the arbitrator, together with other expenses of the arbitration incurred or approved by the arbitrator; and (c) arbitration may proceed in the absence of any party if written notice (pursuant to the JAMS' rules and regulations) of the proceedings has been given to such party. Each party shall bear its own attorney's fees and expenses. The parties agree to abide by all decisions and awards rendered in such proceedings. Such decisions and awards rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and conclusive. All such controversies, claims or disputes shall be settled in this manner in lieu of any action at law or equity; provided however, that nothing in this subsection shall be construed as precluding the bringing an action for injunctive relief or other equitable relief. The arbitrator shall not have the right to award punitive damages or speculative damages to either party and shall not have the power to amend this Agreement. The arbitrator shall be required to follow applicable law. IF FOR ANY REASON THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE BECOMES NOT APPLICABLE, THEN EACH PARTY, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AS TO ANY ISSUE RELATING HERETO IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER MATTER INVOLVING THE PARTDES HERETO.</p>
